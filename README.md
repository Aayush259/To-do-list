# To-Do List Application

## Overview
This is a simple yet powerful To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks with due dates, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. It also features a theme toggle for light and dark modes.

## Features
- Add tasks with a due date
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Toggle between light and dark themes

## How to Use
1. Enter a task in the input field.
2. Select a due date for the task.
3. Click the 'Add' button to add the task to the list.
4. Click the 'tick' button next to a task to mark it as completed. The button will change to a 'cross' and the task status will change to 'Completed'.
5. Click the 'cross' button next to a task to change its status back to 'Pending'. The button will change back to a 'tick'.
6. Click the 'delete' button next to a task to remove it from the list.
7. Click the 'theme' button in the top right corner to toggle between light and dark themes.
